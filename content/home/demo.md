##  research interests

  I am interested in normative and theoretical aspects of economic evaluations and the valuation of health. More specifically, I study the concept of societal health state values, drawing methods and perspectives from various field, including health economics, public health as well as social choice, game, and democratic theory. 
  
  __PhD topic__: *Social tariffs, preference heterogeneity, and collective choice: how to derive societal health state values that reflect the will of the people?*
  __Supervisors:__ Prof. John Brazier and Prof. Ben van Hout

  Apart from that, I have wide-reaching research interests in open science, digital epidemiology, prediction modelling, real-world evidence, health policy, and decision modelling.

## about me

I am a PhD student in the Wellcome Trust docotral training center for Public Health, Economics, and Decision Science at the School of Health and Related Research in Sheffield.

I initially trained as a Medical Doctor but soon became more interested in research. I completed my doctoral thesis on the relationship between staffing and quality of care in hospitals at the Institute for Health Systems Research at the University of Witten/Herdecke in Germany. Subsequently, I did a research masters in health sciences, with a focus on epidemiology and health technology assessment, at Maastricht University in the Netherlands. Before I joined ScHARR in September 2018, I briefly worked as a clinical trial investigator and interned at the WHO in Geneva, Switzerland.

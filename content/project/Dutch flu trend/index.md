##### In the first stage of the project, I investigated whether Wikipedia page views were correlated with the incidence of influenza in several countries around the world.

<br> 

##### Subsequently, I included Google search queries and used several statical learning techniques to estimate the incidence of influenza in Germany in near real time.

##### Finally, we piloted the method during the 2017-2018 influenza-like illness epidemic in the Netherlands.
